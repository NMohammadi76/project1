# Pricing Options and Computing Implied Volatilities with Artificial Neural Networks using real market data

This paper studies a data-driven approach, by means of an artificial neural network (ANN), to value
the financial options and to calculate implied volatilities with the aim of accelerating the corresponding
numerical methods, especially for high-dimensional financial models. We test the ANN approach on
three different solvers, including the closed-form solution for the Black-Scholes equation, the Fast Fourier
transform (FFT) method for the Heston model and Brents root-finding method for the implied volatilities
using real market data . The present numerical results confirm that the ANN can compute option prices
and implied volatilities efficiently and accurately in a robust way.
